**Note on “Position 1” and “Position 2”**

The “Position 1” and “Position 2” folders do not include the recorded signal for the Full STI method, as the file exceeds the 25 MB GitHub size limit.

Instead, each of these folders contains:

  • Test signals for the **STIPA** method
  
  • Signals for the **indirect method** (IR)
  
  • The **impulse response** measured with Room EQ Wizard (**REW**)
  
The 94 dB SPL calibration signal is provided separately in the parent control_measurement folder.
