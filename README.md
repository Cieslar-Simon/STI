# STI – Speech Transmission Index MATLAB Implementation
### Project Overview

**Speech Transmission Index (STI)** is an objective measure (0 to 1 scale) that predicts speech intelligibility by analyzing how a transmission channel (room, audio system, etc.) affects speech signal modulation. A high STI (closer to 1) indicates excellent intelligibility, while a low STI (closer to 0) means poor intelligibility. According to the IEC 60268-16 standard, STI values are categorized from “_bad_” (0–0.3) to “_excellent_” (0.75–1.0), indicating the percentage of syllables correctly understood by listeners. The STI is determined by sending specially modulated test signals through the system and measuring the preservation of amplitude modulations at various frequencies (the **Modulation Transfer Function, MTF**).

This MATLAB project provides an open-source implementation of STI methods as developed in the master’s thesis “_Computing Speech Transmission Index in Matlab_” (Š. Cieslar, Brno University of Technology, 2025) – enabling researchers, students, and practitioners to evaluate speech intelligibility under different conditions.

**Full STI vs. STIPA**: The full STI procedure uses 98 separate test signals covering 7 octave frequency bands and 14 modulation frequencies, requiring roughly a 15-minute measurement. **STIPA** (Speech Transmission Index for Public Address systems) is a simplified, standardized variant of STI that uses a single composite test signal with only two modulation frequencies per band, reducing measurement time to about 15–25 seconds. STIPA provides a quicker estimation of STI with minimal accuracy loss, making it practical for field measurements. This repository implements both the **direct STI methods** – including the exhaustive Full STI and the faster STIPA – and the **indirect method** based on impulse responses. The _direct_ method involves playing a known modulated noise signal through the system and analyzing the recorded output, while the _indirect_ method computes STI by analyzing the system’s measured impulse response (IR). (The indirect IR-based method assumes a linear time-invariant system; it may be less accurate if the audio path includes non-linear elements like companders or limiters.) By providing implementations of all these approaches, the project allows users to compare results and understand how different measurement techniques can be used to assess speech intelligibility.

## Features
+ **Full Direct STI Calculation**: Generation of the full STI test signal (7 octave bands × 14 modulations) and analysis of recorded signals to compute the STI. This includes calculating the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) for each band/modulation frequency and applying standard STI weighting and redundancy corrections. The code can produce the long-format test signal and analyze its playback recording to yield an STI score along with intermediate metrics (modulation indices, per-band intelligibility scores, etc.).
+ **STIPA Method**: Implementation of the **STIPA** simplified test. The repository can generate the standard STIPA test signal (modulated noise with two modulation frequencies per band) and compute STI from a recorded STIPA test playback. This provides a fast estimate of intelligibility using the widely adopted STIPA procedure (per IEC 60268-16). It includes functions for creating the STIPA signal of a desired length and sampling rate, as well as analyzing the recorded response to output the STI value and modulation reduction per octave band.
+ **Indirect STI from Impulse Response**: Tools to calculate STI based on an acoustic **impulse response**. Given a measured IR of the environment or audio chain, the code computes the modulation transfer function by processing the IR (for example, by deriving the frequency response and applying octave-band modulation analysis). This yields an STI prediction without needing the direct playback of modulated noise. An exponential sine sweep signal generation (<code>IR_signal_exp_sweep.m</code>) is provided to facilitate IR measurements, and the measured IR can be fed into the <code>STI_IR.m</code> function to compute STI. This method is useful for cases where an impulse response is known or easier to obtain.
+ **Signal Generation and Processing**: Functions to generate all necessary test signals and to process recorded signals:
  + <code>generateFullSTISignal.m</code> creates the full STI multi-band test signal according to the standard (all modulation frequencies in all octave bands).
  + <code>generateStipaSignal.m</code> produces a STIPA test signal of specified duration and sample rate, containing the proper modulation patterns [github.com](https://github.com/zawi01/stipa#:~:text=The%20full%20STI%20model%20consists,15%20s%20to%2025%20s).
  + <code>IR_signal_exp_sweep.m</code> generates an exponential swept-sine signal for measuring impulse responses (a common method to capture IR while minimizing distortion).
  + Utility functions like <code>addSilenceGaps.m</code> to insert silence between signal bursts if needed for analysis) and <code>convolution.m</code> (for convolving signals with impulse responses or filters) are included to assist in signal processing tasks.
+ **Octave Band Analysis**: The implementation follows the standard’s use of 7 octave frequency bands (centered at 125&nbsp;Hz up to 8&nbsp;kHz). The function <code>octave_band_analysis.m</code> filters signals or IRs into these octave bands and computes band-specific metrics. This is used both in direct and indirect computations to evaluate modulation depth reduction per band in the presence of noise and reverberation.
+ **Comprehensive Analysis Scripts**: Three demonstration scripts are provided to show end-to-end usage:
  + <code>demonstration_fullSTI.m</code> - guides the user through generating the full STI signal, playing or simulating its transmission, analyzing the received signal with <code>fullsti.m</code>, and obtaining the STI result. It also visualizes the modulation transfer matrix or intermediate results.
  + <code>demonstration_stipa.m</code> - demonstrates the STIPA procedure: it can generate or load a STIPA test signal, help simulate or record its playback, then use <code>stipa.m</code> to compute the STI. This script may plot the octave-band modulation indices and display the final STI value in a table or console.
  + <code>demonstration_IR.m</code> - shows how to use a measured impulse response to compute STI via the indirect method. For example, it might load an example IR (provided from a real room measurement) or use a synthetic IR, and then call <code>STI_IR.m</code> to calculate the STI. The script can then compare this indirect result with direct measurements (if available) for validation.
+ **Visualization and Output**: The project includes functions to help interpret the results:
  + <code>displayPlotSTI.m</code> generates plots of the modulation reduction matrix or bar charts of the transmission index per band, helping users visualize how each octave band contributes to the overall STI.
  + <code>displayTableSTI.m</code>prints or returns a formatted table of STI results, possibly including per-octave-band STI values and overall STI (and maybe the CIS (common intelligibility scale) or quality rating).
  + <code>plotSignalWaveform.m</code> and <code>plotIRVisualization.m</code> are utility functions to plot time-domain waveforms of test signals or impulse responses and possibly their envelopes or frequency responses. These help users verify the signals and IRs (for example, checking the quality of a recorded test signal or the decay of an impulse response).
+ **Calibration Support**: A reference calibration tone file <code>calibrator94dB.wav</code> is included, containing a 1 kHz tone at 94&nbsp;dB SPL. This can be used to calibrate the recording system so that the recorded signal levels correspond to real sound pressure levels. By recording this tone with the measurement microphone and adjusting gain such that the analysis recognizes it as 94 dB, subsequent STI measurements can be referenced to absolute SPL. Proper calibration ensures that noise levels and speech levels are correctly accounted for in the STI calculation (per the standard’s requirements).

Together, these features make the repository a full toolset for STI evaluation: from generating test stimuli, through performing measurements or simulations, to computing the intelligibility index and visualizing the results.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized into MATLAB scripts, functions, and data files, with a dedicated folder for measurement data:
+ **Root Directory**: Contains the main analysis functions, scripts, and supporting utilities:
  + **STI computation functions**: <code>fullsti.m</code> (computes Full STI from a recorded signal), <code>stipa.m</code> (computes STI from a STIPA test signal recording), and <code>STI_IR.m</code> (computes STI from an impulse response). These are the core algorithms implementing the STI calculations for each method.
  + **Signal generation**: <code>generateFullSTISignal.m</code> and <code>generateStipaSignal.m</code> create the test signals for Full STI and STIPA respectively. These functions follow the standard modulation specifications to output a waveform that can be played over a loudspeaker for measurement or used in simulations.
  + **Demonstration scripts**: <code>demonstration_fullSTI.m</code>, <code>demonstration_stipa.m</code>, <code>demonstration_IR.m</code> illustrate how to use the above functions. Users can run these scripts in MATLAB to see example workflows (generating signals, reading measurement files, computing STI, and displaying results). Each script is documented with steps for clarity.
  + **Utilities**:
    + <code>octave_band_analysis.m</code> - filters an input signal or IR into the 7 octave bands and computes relevant band-level metrics (e.g., RMS levels or modulation indices in each band).
    + <code>addSilenceGaps.m</code> - inserts silent intervals into a signal (e.g., between bursts of noise). This can be useful for formatting test signals or separating sections in a composite signal.
    + <code>convolution.m</code> - performs convolution of two signals (used for applying an impulse response to a test signal, if simulating a transmission through an acoustic channel within MATLAB).
    + Plotting and display helpers: <code>displayPlotSTI.m</code>, <code>displayTableSTI.m</code> (for results visualization), <code>plotIRVisualization.m</code> (for plotting impulse response characteristics), and <code>plotSignalWaveform.m</code> (for plotting audio waveforms).
  + **Audio/Test data files**: Example data is provided to facilitate quick testing:
    +  <code>stipa_test_signal.wav</code> - an example **STIPA test signal** (generated noise with proper modulation). This can be used for quick experiments or played back for measurement. Users can also generate a fresh one using <code>generateStipaSignal.m</code>.
    +  <code>stipaMeasurement.wav</code> - an **example recorded STIPA signal** captured during the measurement campaign (playing the STIPA test signal through a system and recording at a listener position). This file allows users to try out the <code>stipa.m</code> analysis without needing to immediately perform their own recording.
    +  <code>calibrator94dB.wav</code> - a **calibration tone** (1 kHz sine at 94 dB SPL). This short recording is used to calibrate measurement equipment or verify that the analysis correctly interprets levels. Playing and recording this file in a measurement setup should register as 94 dB in the analysis, ensuring correct level calibration for STI calculations.
+ <code>control_measurements/</code> **folder**: Contains subfolders for the measurement campaign data collected at two positions (see _Measurement Campaign_ below). Each _Position 1_ and _Position 2_ folder includes the following:
  +  **STIPA test signals and recordings**: The STIPA test stimulus and the recorded signal at that position (for direct STIPA method evaluation).
  +  **IR method signals**: The signals related to the indirect method – for example, the recorded exponential sweep or derived impulse response for that position.
  +  **REW impulse response**: An impulse response measured using the Room EQ Wizard (REW) software at that position, provided as a reference. This is a processed IR file that can be directly used with <code>STI_IR.m</code> to compute STI.
  +  _(Note: The Full STI recorded signals are not included here due to file size – see **Limitations**.)_
  +  Additionally, the <code>control_measurements</code> directory contains a README (Information) file describing the contents and how they relate to the measurement campaign.
+ **Documentation and License**: A <code>README.md</code> (this document) provides an overview of the project. The project is open-sourced under the GNU GPL-3.0 License (<code>LICENSE</code> file), in line with the academic intent to allow others to study and use the code.

This structure separates the code logic from experimental data. Users interested in the algorithms can focus on the MATLAB <code>.m</code> files in the root, while those interested in replicating or examining the measurement results can explore the <code>control_measurements</code> subfolders for real-world example data.

## Usage Instructions

**Prerequisites**: To use this repository, you need MATLAB (the code was developed and tested in MATLAB R2024b). No specialized toolboxes are strictly required for basic functionality – the code uses standard MATLAB functions for signal processing (octave-band filtering is implemented manually in <code>ctave_band_analysis.m</code>). However, having the Signal Processing Toolbox or Audio Toolbox may be beneficial for audio I/O and visualization but is not mandatory. Ensure your MATLAB path includes the repository files (you can achieve this by running <code>addpath(genpath('<path-to-repo>'))</code> or by opening MATLAB in the repository folder).

**Cloning the Repository**: Download or clone the <code>Cieslar-Simon/STI</code> repository from GitHub. All necessary <code>.m</code> files and example data will be contained in the folder structure described above. If you plan to use the example measurement data, ensure the <code>control_measurements</code> folder is present with its contents.

**Running a Basic STIPA Analysis**: A simple way to get started is to run the provided STIPA demonstration:
1. Launch MATLAB and navigate to the repository folder.
2. Open and run <code>demonstration_stipa.m</code>. This script will:
  + Generate a STIPA test signal (or load the provided <code>stipa_test_signal.wav</code>).
  + If using provided data: it may load the example recorded response <code>stipaMeasurement.wav</code> (recorded during the campaign) to simulate a real measurement.
  + Call the <code>stipa()</code> function to compute the Speech Transmission Index from the recorded signal.
  + Display the resulting STI value, and plot the modulation depth loss per octave band using <code>displayPlotSTI.m</code> or output a table via <code>displayTableSTI.m</code>.
  + The script will output a final STI score in the MATLAB console and possibly open figures illustrating the intelligibility per frequency band.
3. Review the console output and plots. For example, you might see a plot of 14 modulation indices across 7 bands and a printed table of STI contributions per band, culminating in the overall STI rating (e.g., _STI = 0.65 (Good)_).

**Performing a Full STI Measurement**: To use the full STI method:
1. Use <code>generateFullSTISignal.m</code> to create the full STI test signal. By default, it may generate the standard 15-minute signal. You can specify parameters such as sampling rate or duration if needed.
2. Play this signal through the system or environment under test (e.g., through a loudspeaker in a room). Make sure to record the output with a suitable microphone or recording device.
3. Save the recorded audio (it should contain all 98 modulation combinations in sequence). Due to length, ensure no interruptions occur and the recording device can handle the duration.
4. Use <code>fullsti.m</code> to analyze the recorded waveform. For example: <code>[STI_value, details] = fullsti('recordedFullSTI.wav', fs);</code> (where fs is the sampling rate). This will apply octave filtering, compute modulation transfer ratios for each frequency/modulation combination, and calculate the STI.
5. Review the output. The function may return the overall STI and optionally a structure or matrix of modulation indices. You can use <code>displayPlotSTI.m</code> to visualize the full STI modulation matrix or <code>displayTableSTI.m</code> to see a summary of results.
6. (_Note_: Because a full STI measurement is lengthy and produces a very large file, the repository does not include example full STI recordings. Users can generate and measure this themselves if needed.)

**Using the Indirect IR Method**: If you have an impulse response of the space or system:
1. Ensure the impulse response is available as a WAV or MATLAB array (the repository’s <code>control_measurements</code> includes example IRs measured via REW for reference).
2. Load the impulse response in MATLAB (e.g., <code>[ir, fs] = audioread('Position1_IR_REW.wav');</code>).
3. Run the <code>STI_IR.m</code> function with this IR: <code>STI_val = STI_IR(ir, fs);</code>. The function will likely internally filter the IR into octave bands, compute the modulation frequency response (either by convolving the IR with modulated noise or using the IR’s frequency response to derive MTF according to the standard’s prescribed method), and then compute the STI.
4. The result <code>STI_val</code> is the estimated speech transmission index. You can compare this with any direct measurement at the same position. The demonstration script <code>demonstration_IR.m</code> can be used as a guide; it may automatically load one of the provided IRs and perform the above steps, then possibly compare the indirect STI to a STIPA result at that position.
5. If you need to measure an IR yourself, you can use <code>IR_signal_exp_sweep.m</code> to generate a sweep signal, play it in the environment, record the response, then deconvolve (the script or repository might have instructions for deconvolving the recorded sweep to get the IR).

**Calibration (Optional)**: If absolute accuracy is required (especially in presence of noise), use the calibration tone:
1. Play the <code>calibrator94dB.wav</code> file through your playback system with a standard 94 dB SPL calibrator (or use it to adjust your system output).
2. Record it with the microphone in the measurement chain.
3. Adjust your recording gain such that analyzing this recording yields ~94 dB SPL in the internal calculations. This might involve ensuring that the waveform amplitude corresponds to the calibration level expected by the STI algorithm (some STI calculations need the absolute speech and noise levels).
4. Once calibrated, proceed with STI measurements. This step ensures that the “speech level” and “noise level” inputs to STI calculation are accurate in dB SPL, as required by the IEC standard. (If calibration is not performed, the STI computation will still work, but the results are relative – which is usually acceptable as long as the test signal playback level is within the standard’s specified range.)

**General Notes**: All analysis functions output or plot results that align with the STI standard’s outputs. For example, you can expect the STI score and possibly intermediate measures like _Modulation Index (m)_ for each octave and modulation frequency, _MTF_(modulation transfer function values), and signal-to-noise ratios if noise is involved. The code is documented with comments to help understand the steps. If you wish to modify the code (e.g., to use different noise signals or to test only certain octave bands), the comments and modular structure will assist in making targeted changes.

For any issues or to extend the functionality, refer to the original thesis documentation [mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/discussions/general/842491-speech-transmission-index-for-public-address-stipa-on-github#:~:text=Verification%20Tests%3A) and the references below, which provide the theoretical background. The repository code is meant to be educational and a starting point for further research or customization in the field of speech intelligibility measurement.

## Measurement Campaign

To validate and demonstrate the implemented STI methods, a measurement campaign was conducted at **two different positions** in a real environment. These positions (labeled “Position 1” and “Position 2”) correspond to two distinct listener locations in the test space (for example, two points in a room or auditorium) used to gather comparative intelligibility data. The goal was to see how STI values differ with spatial location or acoustic conditions, and to exercise all three methods (Full STI, STIPA, and IR-based) in parallel.

At each position, the following data were collected:
+ **Full STI recordings**: The full STI test signal (all 98 modulated tones over ~15 minutes) was played through a loudspeaker in the environment and recorded at the microphone position. This recording captures the complete modulation transfer characteristics for that position. _(Due to its large size, this recording is not included in the repository - see **Limitations** below.)_ Nonetheless, the full STI was measured during the campaign for analysis in the thesis [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CPosition%201%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CPosition,25%20MB%20GitHub%20size%20limit).
+ **STIPA measurements**: A standard STIPA test signal (~18 s of modulated noise) was played and recorded at each position. The recorded STIPA signals (provided in the repository) allow computation of STI via the direct STIPA method. Because STIPA uses fewer modulation frequencies, it offers a quick check of speech intelligibility at each spot, which was useful for on-site assessments.
+ **Impulse Response (IR) measurements**: The acoustic impulse response at each position was measured. This was done by playing an exponential sine sweep through the speaker and recording the response, then deconvolving to obtain the IR. The repository includes the signals related to this indirect method (e.g., the recorded sweep or the resulting IR). Additionally, for validation, impulse responses were measured using a third-party tool (Room EQ Wizard, REW). The final IRs obtained (especially the REW-measured IR files) are provided for each position [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=). These IRs can be used with the <code>STI_IR.m</code> function to compute the STI indirectly and compare with the direct method results.
+ **Environmental conditions**: During the measurements, background noise and other conditions were noted. For instance, Position 2 might have been farther from the speaker or in a more reverberant part of the room, presumably yielding a lower STI than Position 1 (which could be closer or in line-of-fire of the speaker). Such differences are reflected in the collected data and the computed STI values (e.g., one position might be “Good” intelligibility while the other drops to “Fair” or “Poor” due to added reverberation or noise).
+ **Calibration tone**: Before and/or after measurements, a 1&nbsp;kHz calibrator at 94&nbsp;dB SPL was recorded at each position to ensure that levels in the recordings correspond to actual sound pressure levels
[github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=). This step validated that the test signal playback level was within the standard’s required range and that the measuring equipment was correctly adjusted.

All measurement data are organized in the repository under <code>control_measurements/Position 1/</code> and <code>Position 2/</code>. Within each, you will find the recorded STIPA signal, the IR measurement files (both the raw sweep response and the processed IR, possibly), and the REW-derived IR. By using these files with the provided MATLAB functions, you can replicate the thesis analysis - for example, compute STI for Position 1 via the STIPA method and via the IR method, and observe how they compare.

This measurement campaign demonstrates the practical application of the code in real-world scenarios. It provides example cases for users to experiment with, and it illustrates the typical use of STI in evaluating how intelligible a public address or sound system will be at different listener locations. For detailed discussions of the measurement setup and results, please refer to the thesis document and Reference [[1]](#1) which inspired parts of this work [mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/discussions/general/842491-speech-transmission-index-for-public-address-stipa-on-github#:~:text=Control%20Measurements%3A).

## Limitations
+ **Full STI Recording Omission**: The raw recorded audio for the full 15-minute STI test at both Position 1 and Position 2 is not included in this GitHub repository. Each such file is very large (exceeding GitHub’s single-file upload limit of 25&nbsp;MB)
[github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9CPosition%201%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CPosition,25%20MB%20GitHub%20size%20limit). Consequently, while the code includes the capability to analyze full STI recordings, users who wish to try this will need to generate and record the full STI signal themselves. (Alternatively, one could split the full signal into smaller files, but that was beyond the scope of this project distribution.)
+ **Included Measurement Data**: In place of the full recordings, the repository provides smaller, representative files for each position:
  +  **STIPA signals**: For both positions, the test signal and/or the recorded STIPA result are included [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Test%20signals%20for%20the,method). This allows direct STI computation for those positions using the STIPA method. Users can run <code>stipa.m</code> on these recordings to get the STI without needing the full signal.
  +  **IR-based signals**: The recorded signals used for the indirect method (such as the exponential sweep recordings) are provided, or in some cases the IR extracted from them is provided. This enables users to run <code>STI_IR.m</code> and obtain the STI via the impulse response approach for each position [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Test%20signals%20for%20the,method).
  +  **REW Impulse Responses**: For convenience and verification, the Room EQ Wizard measured IRs for each position are included as files (for example, <code>.wav</code> or <code>.txt</code> files containing the impulse response) [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20,REW). These can be considered a ground truth or an alternate way to feed the STI calculation. Having these also means you can compute STI indirectly without running the sweep deconvolution yourself.
+ **Calibration File**: The 94 dB SPL calibration tone (<code>calibrator94dB.wav</code>) is included in the top-level of <code>control_measurements</code> (rather than inside each position folder) [github.com](https://github.com/Cieslar-Simon/STI/commit/6ffe7222131307bd144170221d8ee621fdb9f3be#:~:text=). This file is small (a few seconds) and is provided to help users calibrate their system. However, note that using it is optional; the STI calculations will run on the audio data regardless, but calibration is recommended if you’re comparing to absolute standards or among different setups.
+ **No Real-Time Interface**: The code and examples are meant for offline analysis of recorded data. There is no real-time STI meter GUI included. Users must run the scripts or functions in MATLAB manually. For most research and educational purposes this is sufficient, but it may not be immediately suitable for continuous real-time monitoring without further development.
+ **Toolbox Requirements**: The implementation tries to avoid non-core toolboxes (for example, by implementing octave filtering internally). However, if any functions require a specific toolbox (e.g., audio I/O or advanced plotting), those would need to be installed. Typically, standard MATLAB installations will cover everything needed for analysis since the heavy lifting is done via custom code.
+ **Accuracy and Standards Compliance**: This implementation is designed to follow the IEC 60268-16 standard as closely as possible [github.com](https://github.com/zawi01/stipa#:~:text=Speech%20Transmission%20Index%20,modulations%2C%20which%20simulate%20speech%20signals) and has been tested against reference calculations and verification tests from literature [mathworks.com](https://github.com/zawi01/stipa#:~:text=Speech%20Transmission%20Index%20,modulations%2C%20which%20simulate%20speech%20signals). Nonetheless, minor deviations might exist compared to dedicated STI measurement instruments. For instance, the modulation frequencies and weighting factors are as per the standard’s third edition (which is the ČSN EN IEC 60268-16 ed. 3 reference [[2]](#2)), and the code uses those values. It’s always good to verify critical results with a certified STI meter if available. The uncertainty of a single STI measurement is about ±0.02–0.03 STI units [github.com](https://github.com/zawi01/stipa#:~:text=The%20uncertainty%20associated%20with%20a,measurements%20and%20average%20the%20results), so repeated measurements may vary slightly.
+ **File Size and Format**: All audio files are provided as uncompressed WAV to ensure no quality loss. Keep in mind that the sample rate of test signals and recordings matters – the standard requires at least 16 kHz bandwidth (typically tests use 48 kHz sampling). The provided signals use a suitable sampling rate (often 48 kHz). If you use a significantly different sample rate, ensure the octave band filters still function as intended (they are likely designed for standard band center frequencies).

Despite these limitations, the repository should serve as a comprehensive starting point for STI computation. Users can extend the code or incorporate their own data. For example, you could integrate this MATLAB code into a larger measurement framework, or adapt the signal generation for custom intelligibility tests. Always be mindful of the conditions (noise, non-linear processing, etc.) where each method is applicable [github.com](https://github.com/zawi01/stipa#:~:text=the%20direct%20STIPA%20method), and use the appropriate method accordingly (direct STIPA for quick on-site checks, full STI for detailed analysis when time permits, or IR method for theoretical studies and cases where an IR is known).
